# Do you reach for the stars?
The Mechanical Engineering Outreach Subcommittee is launching the MEOS (Mechanical Engineering Outreach Stars) program! The MEOS program rewards and incentivizes individuals and student groups to participate in outreach activities.

# How to Apply
Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIHSbRC6QrDZQijpllXZrZnV13MHvGK0o3DlkFLofDPrDPng/viewform?usp=sf_link) detailing each outreach activity that occurred __between May 1, 2021 and Apr. 30, 2022__. Please email us your letters of support at [meche-outreach@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:meche-outreach@andrew.cmu.edu). The deadline for submitting your entries is __May 27, 2022__.

Once we gather all the entries, we will review them and award each group a badge based on our tiered system below. They will be able to display the badge on their website, and we will announce the winners to the MechE community. If you have any issues or questions, please email us at [meche-outreach@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:meche-outreach@andrew.cmu.edu).
